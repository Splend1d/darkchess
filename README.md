V1 alpha-beta logic 2W-18D, human evaluation tied positions : 4W2L 

V2 "obeserver" logic 1W-17D-2L , human evaluation tied positions : 9W2L 

V3 added branching score 10W-10D-0L

V4 added uncontested king special case, change branching score to branching count for both players at the last position (including Quiescent)

V5 branching score now considers importance of chess piece *17W-3D-0L
